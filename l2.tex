{\color{red}{Show results for wave evolution and L2 error norms}}
To provide a more quantitative measure of the differences in the moist baroclinic wave solutions, figure 4 shows the l2 difference norm of the surface pressure field (eqn.16 in Jablonowski and Williamson 2006) between the CESM2-SE and CESM1.5-SE simulations. The relative magnitude of the l2 difference norm is assessed in a similar manner to Jablownowski and Williamson (2016), through comparison with an estimate of the uncertainty of a high resolution reference simulation. The uncertainty in the reference is taken as the l2 difference norm between a pair of 1/4 degree simulations using different dynamical cores, in this case CESM2-SE and CESM2-FV.
