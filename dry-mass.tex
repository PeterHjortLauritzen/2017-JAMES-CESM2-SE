\begin{abstract}
It is the purpose of this paper to document and validate the new NCAR version of the spectral-element (SE) dynamical core as part of the CESM2.0 release. This version differs from previous releases of the SE dynamical core in several ways. Most notably the hybrid-sigma vertical coordinate is based on dry pressure, the condensates are dynamically active in the thermodynamic and momentum equations (also referred to as condensate loading), and the continuous equations of motion conserve a more comprehensive total energy that includes condensates. The code base has been significantly reduced and cleaned up as part of integrating SE as a dynamical core in the CAM (Community Atmosphere Model) repository rather than importing the SE dynamical core from HOMME (high-order method modeling environment) as an external code.

\section{Introduction}
Over the last two decades or so the spectral-element (SE) method has been considered as a candidate next-generation numerical method for the fluid flow solver in  global weather/climate models \citep{FT2004MWR,BWTF2006MWR,KG2012JCP,GKC2013SIAM} {\color{red}{other references needed?}}. The main motivations were the SE methods near perfect scalability, high-order accuracy for smooth problems, and mesh-refinement capabilities. For a while the Community Earth System Model \citep[CESM; ][]{CESM1} has had a highly scalable dynamical core option in the atmosphere component CAM \citep[Community Atmosphere Model; ][]{CAM5} based on the SE method discretized on the cubed-sphere. The SE model supports uniform resolution grids based on the equi-angular gnomonic cubed-sphere grid and a mesh-refinement configuration with local increases in resolution through conformal mesh-refinement \citep{FT2004MWR,BWTF2006MWR,ZJT2013,ZetAl2014JCb}. The dynamical core code resided in the High-Order Methods Modeling environment (HOMME) which is a framework for developing new generation computationally efficient and petascale capable dynamical cores based on the SE method \citep{TL2000JSC,TES2008JPCS}, the discontinuous Galerkin method \citep{NCT2009CF} and finite-volume method \citep{ELGT2012PCS,LTOUNGK2017MWR}. The SE dynamical core was imported into CAM as an external code base. Consequently any updates to the HOMME code base would have to be imported into CAM and pass regression tests in both HOMME and CAM. We refer to this setup as CAM-HOMME which has been tested quite extensively for AMIP-style climate simulation \citep{ELMNTT2012JC,BetAl2013JC,RetAl2015GRL}.

With the department of energy (DOE) branching from the CESM to develop their on Earth System Model using their own code base, NCAR decided to no longer import HOMME as an external code base in CAM due to the cumbersome software engineering involved in maintaining two code bases and having to support configurations in HOMME not used in CAM. Instead the SE configuration of HOMME became part of the CAM code base. With that came a massive code clean-up to satisfy software engineering standards in CAM (and make the code more user-friendly for the community) as well as considerable science changes described in this paper.

The SE dynamical core is the default dynamical core for high-resolution CESM applications, in particular, the configuration in which the average distance between grid-point is approximately 25km \citep{BetAl2013JC}. At such resolutions the effects of condensates (such as cloud liquid and ice) may have a significant effect on the dynamics \citep{BLDT2012GRL}. CAM-HOMME does not represent the effect of condensates in the thermodynamic and momentum equations (also referred to as condensate loading). Representing condensates in the dynamical core is easier when using a dry-mass hybrid-sigma vertical coordinate than when using the usual moist-mass hybrid-sigma vertical coordinate \citep[e.g., ][]{SB1981MWR}. In other words, the model levels are defined in terms of dry atmosphere surface pressure rather than moist (full) surface pressure.

A second motivation for switching to a dry-mass vertical coordinate is the physical parameterizations. CAM physics assumes that the moist pressure levels are constant during the parameterization updates. Consequently the pressure levels stay constant even when moisture leaves the column (e.g., rain). At the very end of CAM physics the change in water  vapor in each column is taken into account by scaling the mixing ratio's for all tracers based on specific mixing ratios so that dry air mass and tracer mass is conserved \citep[see Section 3.1.6 in ][]{CAM5}. This scaling does not guarantee shape-preservation. Also, the pressure in CAM physics does not take into account the mass of condensates. When using a dry-mass vertical coordinate, the coordinate surfaces (assuming dry mass is constant) remain constant throughout the physics updates and there is no need to adjust tracer mixing ratios and one can more rigorously take into account the work performed by water variables in the context of the energy cycle.

The third motivation for using a dry-mass vertical coordinate relates to total energy conservation. Currently the energy fixer in CAM is based on a dry total energy \citep{WOHTTV2015JAMES} that uses that same heat-capacity for dry air and water vapor, and does not include the effect of condensates. To move towards a more accurate treatment of energy in CAM, a first step is to develop a dynamical core based on equations of motion conserving an energy that properly represents water vapor as well as condensates. This is most easily done when using a dry-mass vertical coordinate so that the energies associates with all water variables are clearly separated.

In this paper we present a version of the SE dynamical core using a dry-mass vertical coordinate, includes condensate-loading, and the continuous equations of motion conserve a comprehensive moist total energy that includes all prognostic water variables and their respective heat capacities in the thermodynamic equation. As this paper serves as documentation for the CESM2 version of SE we also provide details on the spectral-element method and viscosity operators. 

The paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{sec:cont-eq} the continuous equations of motion are derived which involves a detailed discussion of moist thermodynamics in the presence of condensates. The axial angular momentum (AAM) and total energy conservation properties of this system of equations is also discussed. In section \ref{sec:discretized_eqs} the discretized equations of motion with focus on the vertical discretization in dry-mass vertical coordinates are documented. Details on the horizontal SE discretization on the cubed-sphere are presented. Last there is the results section \ref{sec:results} where the new dynamical core is validated in idealized setups. First using a moist baroclinic wave with simple warm-rain micro-physics and secondly in a CAM6 aqua-planet configuration. The computational performance of CAM-SE is also discussed in section \ref{sec:results}. The paper ends with summary and conclusions in section \ref{sec:concl}.

\section{Continuous equations}\label{sec:cont-eq}
Before writing the continuous equations of motion using a dry-mass vertical coordinate, we first need to discuss the representation of water variables (section \ref{sec:mixing_ratios}), discuss the ideal gas law and derive the thermodynamic equation for a mixture containing all water variables not just water vapor (section \ref{sec:tv}). The discussion of the equations of motion in the presence of water vapor, cloud liquid and ice closely follows \citet{joyOfUM}. Thereafter dry mass vertical coordinate is defined in section \ref{eq:vertical_coord}. {\color{red}{more details on other sections}}
\subsection{Representation of water phases in terms of dry and wet (specific) mixing ratios}\label{sec:mixing_ratios}
Define the dry mixing ratios for the water variables (vapor 'wv', cloud liquid 'cl', cloud ice 'ci', rain 'rn' and snow 'sw')
\begin{equation}
m^{(\ell)}\equiv \frac{\rho^{(\ell)}}{\rho^{(d)}}, \text{ where }\ell=`wv`,`cl`,`ci`,`rn`,`sw`\label{eq:mx}
\end{equation}
where $\rho^{(d)}$ is the mass of dry air per unit volume of moist air and $\rho^{(\ell)}$ is the mass of the water substance of type $\ell$ per unit volume of moist air.  Note that  the mixing ratio for dry air is one: $m^{(d)}\equiv \frac{\rho^{(d)}}{\rho^{(d)}}=1$. 
By moist air we refer to air containing dry air, water vapor, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain amount and snow amount. For notational purposes define the set of all components of air
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{all}=\left\{ `d`,`wv`,`cl`,`ci`,`rn`,`sw`\right\},
\end{equation}
a set only referring to all water variables,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{water}=\left\{`wv`,`cl`,`ci`,`rn`,`sw`\right\},
\end{equation}
and a set referring to all condensates (non-gas components of water)
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{cond}=\left\{`cl`,`ci`,`rn`,`sw`\right\}.
\end{equation}
The density of a unit volume of moist air is related to the dry air density through
\begin{equation}
\rho=\rho^{(d)}\left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right).
\end{equation}
Mixing ratio's can also be specified in terms of density per density of moist air, in other words, specific/moist mixing ratios
\begin{equation}
q^{(\ell)}\equiv \frac{\rho^{(\ell)}}{\rho}, \text{ where }\ell=`wv`,`cl`,`ci`,`rn`,`sw`\label{eq:qx}.
\end{equation}
where, in particular, $q^{(wv)}$ is the specific humidity. 


It is straight forward to convert between moist and dry mixing ratios
\begin{align}
m^{(\ell)}&=\frac{q^{(\ell)}}{1-\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{water}} q^{(\ell)}},\label{eq:mxqx}\\
q^{(\ell)}&=\frac{m^{(\ell)}}{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}}.
\end{align}
Note that if water vapor undergoes a phase change to rain and leaves the column, then the specific/wet mixing ratios change but the dry mixing ratios do not.


%
\subsection{Ideal gas law and virtual temperature}\label{sec:tv}
In this section the ideal gas law is derived for moist air containing condensates. Part of that derivation is the definition of virtual temperature. 

If we assume that moist air obeys Amagat's law (or the law of partial volumes) then a unit volume of moist air $V=1$ is the sum the volume of dry air and the volumes of the different forms of water in the air
\begin{equation}
V=\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} V^{(\ell)}.\label{eq:Volumes}
\end{equation}
Now let $\alpha\equiv \frac{1}{\rho}$ denote the specific volume of moist air, let $\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}$ be the specific volume of the gaseous components of moist air (the volume of water vapor and dry air per unit mass of water vapor and dry air), let $\hat{\alpha}^{(cl)}$ be the specific volume of cloud liquid (i.e. volume occupied by unit mass of cloud liquid), and similarly for cloud ice, rain and snow. Then we can write \eqref{eq:Volumes} in terms of densities and specific volumes
\begin{equation}
\rho \alpha=\rho^{(gas)}\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}+\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}_{cond}}\rho^{(\ell)}\hat{\alpha}^{(\ell)},\label{eq:massV}
\end{equation}
where $\rho^{(gas)}=\rho^{(d)}+\rho^{(wv)}$. Note that $\hat{\alpha}^{(\ell)}\neq \frac{1}{\rho^{(\ell)}}$ since $\rho^{(\ell)}$ is defined in terms mass of $\ell$ per unit volume of moist air and not mass of $\ell$ per unit volume of water phase $\ell$. Dividing \eqref{eq:massV} with $\rho^{(d)}$ and substituting \eqref{eq:mx} yields
\begin{equation}
  \left(\sum_\ell m^{(\ell)}\right) \alpha = \left( 1+m^{(wv)}\right) \hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}+\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}_{cond}}m^{(\ell)}\hat{\alpha}^{(\ell)}.\label{eq:vol}
\end{equation}
The ideal gas law for the gaseous components, using Dalton's law of partial pressures, is
\begin{equation}
p=p^{(d)}+p^{(wv)}=\rho^{(d)} R^{(d)} T+\rho^{(wv)} R^{(wv)} T,\label{eq:ig}
\end{equation}
where $p^{(d)}$ is the dry pressure and $p^{(wv)}$ is the water vapor pressure. We may write \eqref{eq:ig} in terms of $\rho^{(gas)}$ by multiplying \eqref{eq:ig} with $\frac{\rho^{(gas)}}{\rho^{(gas)}}$ and write the equation in terms of mixing ratios
\begin{equation}
p=\rho R^{(d)} T\rho^{(gas)}\left( \frac{\rho^{(d)}}{\rho^{(gas)}}+\frac{\rho^{(wv)}}{\rho^{(gas)}}\frac{R^{(wv)}}{R^{(d)}}\right)=\frac{R^{(d)} \rho^{(gas)}T\left( 1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}m^{(wv)}\right)}{\left(1+m^{(wv)}\right)}\label{eq:ig2}.
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon\equiv \frac{R^{(d)}}{R^{(wv)}}$. Since \eqref{eq:ig} holds for the gaseous components only we may substitute $\frac{1}{\rho^{(gas)}}$ with $\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}$ to get:
\begin{equation}
p=\frac{R^{(d)} T\left( 1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}m^{(wv)}\right)}{\left(1+m^{(wv)}\right)\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}}\label{eq:ig3}.
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{eq:vol} to eliminate $\left(1+m^{(wv)}\right)\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}$ in \eqref{eq:ig3} and simplifying yields
\begin{equation}
p=\rho R^{(d)} T_v\label{eq:igl},
\end{equation}
where the virtual temperature is given by
\begin{equation}
T_v =T\left[ \frac{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}m^{(wv)}}{1+m^{(wv)}+\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}_{cond}}m^{(\ell)}\left(1-\frac{\hat{\alpha}^{(\ell)}}{\alpha}\right)}\right].
\end{equation}
The ratio of the density of moist air to the density of the condensates are negligible (e.g., the terms $\frac{\hat{\alpha}^{(cl)}}{\alpha}$ and $\frac{\hat{\alpha}^{(cl)}}{\alpha}$ are of order $10^{-3}$ or less) hence the formula for virtual temperature is simplified to
\begin{equation}
T_v =T\left( \frac{1+\frac{1}{\epsilon}m^{(wv)}}{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}}m^{(\ell)}}\right).\label{eq:tv}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Thermodynamic equation}
The first law of thermodynamics for a mixture of dry air, water vapor, cloud liquid water, cloud ice, rain and snow is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}_{all}} c_{v}^{(\ell)}\, m^{(\ell)}}{\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}}\delta T+p\delta \alpha=\delta Q,\label{eq:1stT}
\end{equation}
where $\delta Q$ is the amount of heat per unit mass that is supplied reversibly to the moist air, $\delta T$ and $\delta \alpha$ are the moist airs temperature and specific volume changes and $c_v^{(\ell)}$ is the heat capacity at constant volume for component $\ell$ of moist air. Note that
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right)p\delta \alpha &=& p \delta \left[ \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)} \right)\alpha  \right],\label{eq:pdalpha}\\
                                       &=& (1+m^{(wv)})p\delta \hat{\alpha}^{(gas)},\label{eq:pdalpha2}\\
                                       &=& \left(R^{(d)}+m^{(wv)}R^{(wv)}\right)\left(\delta T-\frac{T}{p}\delta p\right)\label{eq:dt}.
\end{eqnarray}
where, in \eqref{eq:pdalpha}, we have assumed that $m^{(\ell)}$ is constant. To get \eqref{eq:pdalpha2} we substituted \eqref{eq:vol} into the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:pdalpha} and assumed that cloud ice and liquid are incompressible ($\delta \hat{\alpha}^{(cl)}=0$ and $\delta \hat{\alpha}^{(ci)}=0$). Finally \eqref{eq:ig3} has been used to substitute for $\hat{\alpha}^{(gas)}$ in \eqref{eq:dt}.
Using \eqref{eq:dt} in the First law of thermodynamics \eqref{eq:1stT}, substituting $R^{(d)}=c_v^{(d)}-c_v^{(d)}$ and $R^{(wv)}=c_p^{(wv)}-c_{v}^{(wv)}$, using that $c_p^{(\ell)}=c^{(\ell)}_v$ for the condensates (they are incompressible) and rearranging terms yields
\begin{equation}
\delta T-\frac{\left(R^{(d)}+m^{(wv)}R^{(wv)}\right)}{\left(\sum c_p^{(\ell)}m^{(\ell)}\right)}\frac{T}{p}\delta p=\frac{\left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right)}{\left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} c_p^{(\ell)}m^{(\ell)}\right)}\frac{\delta Q}{T}.\label{eq:thermo1}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:thermo1} can be written in a more familiar form
\begin{equation}
\delta T-\frac{R}{c_p}\frac{T}{p}\delta p=\frac{1}{c_p T}\delta Q\label{eq:thermo},
\end{equation}
if we define $c_p$ and $R$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
c_p&=&\frac{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} c_p^{(\ell)}m^{(\ell)}}{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}},\label{eq:cp} \\
R  &=&\frac{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} R^{(\ell)} m^{(\ell)}}{\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}}.
\end{eqnarray}
where $R^{(\ell)}=0$ for $\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{cond}$. Note that with these definitions of $c_p$ and $R$ the ideal gas law can be written as
\begin{equation}
p=\rho R T,\label{eq:ig4}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
c_p=R+c_v.
\end{equation}
The thermodynamic equation \eqref{eq:thermo} may also be written in terms of full density
\begin{equation}
\delta T-\frac{1}{\rho\, c_p}\delta p=\frac{1}{c_p T}\delta Q\label{eq:thermo2}.
\end{equation}
%
\subsection{Vertical coordinate}\label{eq:vertical_coord}
\subsubsection{Definition}
Let $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}_s$ be the surface pressure of a dry atmosphere  and $\mathcal{P}_t^{(d)}$ the pressure at the model top. We assume that there is no moisture or condensate above the model top so $p_t^{(d)}=p_t^{(wv)}=\mathcal{P}_t^{(d)}$. Consider a general, terrain-following, vertical coordinate $\eta^{(d)}$ that is a function of dry atmosphere pressure $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}$ 
\begin{equation}
\eta^{(d)}=h(\mathcal{P}^{(d)},\mathcal{P}_s^{(d)}),
\end{equation}
where $h(\mathcal{P}s^{(d)},\mathcal{P}s^{(d)})=1$ and $h(\mathcal{P}t^{(d)},\mathcal{P}s^{(d)})=0$. Note that by removing the superscript $(d)$ from the equations above so that the dry variable represent moist pressure variables then the vertical coordinate is the usual hybrid-pressure coordinate widely used in hydrostatic global modeling \citep{SB1981MWR}. The top and bottom boundary conditions are that $\dot{\eta}\left({\mathcal{P}s^{(d)},\mathcal{P}s^{(d)}}\right)=0$ and $\dot{\eta}\left( \mathcal{P}t^{(d)},\mathcal{P}s^{(d)}\right)=0$. Note that using a dry-mass vertical coordinate simplifies the coupling to physics since the dry mass coordinates do not change location if there are water-vapor (or other phase changes) in the column.
\subsubsection{Dry pressure and dry atmosphere pressure}
The observant reader will have noticed that we denote the dry atmosphere pressure $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}$ and not $p^{(d)}$. The moist pressure at given height $z'$ can be computed from the hydrostatic balance
\begin{align}
p&=\int^{z'=\infty}_{z'=z}\rho\, g\, dz',\\
 &=\int^{z'=\infty}_{z'=z}\rho_d \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_\ell \right)\, g\, dz',\\
 &=\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \mathcal{P}^{(\ell)},\label{eq:z'2}
\end{align}
where the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:z'2} is the weight of dry air, water vapor, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and snow per unit area, respectively:
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal{P}}^{(\ell)}=\int^{z'=\infty}_{z'=z}\rho_d \, m_\ell \, g\, dz'\label{eq:z'}.
\end{equation}
Using Dalton's law of partial pressures, \eqref{eq:z'2} can be written as
\begin{equation}
p^{(d)}+p^{(wv)}=\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} {\mathcal{P}}^{(\ell)}.\label{eq:dalton}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq:dalton} it is clear that in the presence of condensate one can not equate $p^{(d)}$ with ${\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}$ and equate $p^{(wv)}$ with ${\mathcal{P}}^{(wv)}$. The dry pressure and water vapor pressure are both affected by the weight of the condensates even though the condensates do not exert a pressure. Hence the dry pressure $p^{(d)}$ is different from the pressure in a dry atmosphere $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}$. The hydrostatic balance of a dry atmosphere, written in terms of differentials, is given by
\begin{equation}
d\mathcal{P}^{(d)}=-\rho_d g dz,\label{eq:dry_atm_hydro}
\end{equation}
whereas, in a moist atmosphere, a dry pressure hydrostatic equation does not hold
\begin{equation}
dp^{(d)}\ne -\rho_d g dz.
\end{equation}
The differential of the moist pressure can be written in terms of the dry atmosphere pressure though:
\begin{equation}
dp=-\rho g \, dz = -\rho_d \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_\ell\right)g\, dz = d\mathcal{P}^{(d)}\left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_\ell\right).
\end{equation}

%p_s=p^{(d)}+p^{(wv)}=\int

%
\subsection{Equations of motion}
The $\eta^{(d)}$-coordinate adiabatic and frictionless atmospheric primitive equations assuming floating Lagrangian vertical coordinates \citep{S1945JAS,L2004MWR} can be written as
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + \left( \zeta + f \right) {\hat{\vec{k}}} \times \vec{v}  + \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \left( \frac12 \vec{v}^2 + \Phi \right)  + \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} p &= 0,\label{E:PEmom} \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} T  -  \frac{1}{c_p \rho} \omega  &= 0, \label{E:PEtemp} \\
%\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) + \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot   \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \vec{v} \right)  &= \nu \nabla^4_{\eta^{(d)}} \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right), \label{E:PEcont} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} m^{(\ell)} \right) +  \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot   \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} m^{(\ell)} \vec{v} \right)  &= 0, \quad \ell=`d`,`wv`,`cl`,`ci`, \label{E:PEq}
\end{align}
where $\rho$ is the full density $\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \rho^{(\ell)}$, $p$ is moist pressure, $\Phi$ is the geopotential height ($\Phi=g\, z$, where $g$ is the gravitational constant), ${\hat{\vec{k}}}$ is the unit vector normal to the surface of the sphere, $\zeta = {\hat{\vec{k}}} \cdot {\nabla \times} \vec{v}$ is vorticity, $f$ Coriolis parameter, and $\omega = Dp/Dt$ is the pressure vertical velocity. 

The prognostic equations for $\vec{v}$, the temperature $T$, pseudo density of a dry atmosphere ${\frac{\partial {\mathcal{P}^{(d)}}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}}$, and pseudo tracer density ${\frac{\partial {\mathcal{P}^{(d)}}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}} m^{(\ell)}$ are solved with the diagnostic equation for geopotential height (hydrostatic balance)
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Phi\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}=-\frac{R^{(d)} \,T_v}{p}\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}},\label{eq:phi_1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right).
\end{equation}
For diagnosing vertical pressure velocity $\omega$ we note that
\begin{align}
\omega(\eta^{(d)})&=\frac{dp}{dt}(\eta^{(d)}),\\
      &=\int_{\eta^{(d)}}^{\eta^{(d)}=0}\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)d\eta^{(d)},\\
      &=\int_{\eta^{(d)}}^{\eta^{(d)}=0}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)d\eta^{(d)}+\int_{\eta^{(d)}}^{\eta^{(d)}=0} \vec{v}\cdot \nabla \left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)d\eta^{(d)}.\label{eq:omega}
\end{align}
\subsection{Hyperviscosity and frictional heating}
The spectral-element method does not have implicit diffusion hence hyperviscosity operators are applied to the prognostic variables to dissipate energy near the grid scale. Hyperviscosity also damp the propagation of spurious grid-scale modes \citep{AW2009SIAM}. For the uniform resolution configuration constant hyperviscosity coefficients are used whereas the variable resolution configuration uses either a scaling of the coefficients according to the local element length scale \citep{ZJT2013} or a tensor-based hyperviscosity operator \citep{GetAl2014GMD}.
\subsubsection{Viscosity operator}\label{sec:hyper}
On the right-hand side of the equations of motion hyperviscosity terms are added. For the momentum equations \eqref{E:PEmom} the viscous terms are as follows. By using the vector identity  $\nabla^2 \vec{v} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) - \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{v}) $, the viscosity term splits into two terms. One that damps divergent modes and one that damps rotational modes. Thereby one can damp divergent modes more (or less) than rotational modes by having different coefficients ($\nu_d$ and $\nu_v$, respectively) in front of the respective terms
 \begin{equation}
  \nu \nabla^2 \vec{v} = \nu_d \, \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) -
   \nu_v \,  \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{v}).\label{eq:vec_diff}
 \end{equation}
By iteratively applying the Laplacian operator \eqref{eq:vec_diff} the 4th-order hyperviscosity operator results.

The pseudo-density and temperature are damped with $\nu \nabla^4\left\{ \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}-\left(\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)^{(ref)}\right\}$ and $\nu \nabla^4 T$. The horizontal hyperviscosity operator can be applied on $\eta_d$-surfaces, $\nu \nabla^4=\nu \nabla^4_{\eta_d}$, but it may be advantageous to apply the hyperviscosity operator on approximate pressure surfaces
\begin{equation}
\nu \nabla^4 \Xi =\nu \nabla^4_{\eta_d}-\frac{\partial \Xi}{\partial p}\nu \nabla^4_{\eta_d}p,\qquad \Xi=\vec{v}, T,
\end{equation}
\citep[p.58 in ][]{CAM5} to reduce spurious diffusion over steep topography. In theory the damping of the pseudo-density should be zero if hyperviscosity is applied on pressure surfaces. However, for stability it is necessaary to damp pressure-level thicknesses but instead of applying $\nabla^4$ to $\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}$ it is applied to the difference between $\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}$ and a smoothed version of $\frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}$ referred to as $\left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)^{(ref)}$. The computation of the smoothed reference profile is described in the next section.

\subsubsection{Frictional heating}
Let the $\delta \vec{v}$ be the change in the velocity vector due to diffusion of momentum. Then the change in kinetic energy due hyperviscosity applied to $\vec{v}$ is $\frac{1}{2}\rho \vec{v} \cdot \delta \vec{v}$. This kinetic energy is converted to a heating rate by adding a heating term $\delta \mathcal{T}$ in the thermodynamic equation corresponding to the kinetic energy change
\begin{equation}
\rho c_p \delta \mathcal{T}=-\frac{1}{2}\rho \vec{v} \cdot \delta \vec{v} \Rightarrow
 \delta \mathcal{T}=-\frac{1}{c_p}\left(\vec{v}\cdot \delta \vec{v}\right),\label{eq:tcp}
\end{equation}
\citep[p.71 in ][]{CAM5}. As shown in the results section this term is rather large and therefore important for good energy conservation characteristics of the dynamical core.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Global conservation}
Below it is shown that the continuous equations of motion, that include the effect of condensates, conserve AAM and total energy. For the derivations first note that adding the continuity equations $\ell=`d`,`wv`,`cl`,`ci`$ \eqref{E:PEq}, using hydrostatic balance \eqref{eq:phi_1} and ideal gas law \eqref{eq:igl}, yields a moist air continuity
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left(\frac{\partial z\quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \cdot \left[ \vec{v}\rho  \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right]=0,\label{eq:cont2}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, in Lagrangian form
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\delta A\right]=0,\label{eq:lagra_cont}
\end{equation}
where $\delta A$ is a horizontal area of a Lagrangian air parcel so that $\nabla \cdot \vec{v}=\frac{1}{\delta A}\frac{D}{Dt}\left( \delta A\right)$, and  $\frac{D}{Dt}=\frac{\partial }{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla $ is the material/total derivative. 
\subsubsection{Axial angular momentum (AAM)}
The conservation law for angular momentum is derived in spherical coordinates for which the zonal momentum equation takes the form
\begin{equation}
\frac{Du}{Dt}=\frac{u v \tan \varphi}{r}+2\Omega v\sin \varphi -\frac{1}{\rho r \cos \varphi}\frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda},\label{eq:tmp200}
\end{equation}
where $u$ and $v$ the zonal and meridional velocity components, respectively, $\varphi$ is latitude and $\lambda$ longitude, $\Omega$ rotation rate of Earth ($f=2\Omega \sin \varphi$), and $r$ is the mean radius of Earth.\\

The conservation law for AAM, $\mathcal{M}=\left( u+\Omega r \cos \varphi \right) r \cos \varphi$, can be conveniently derived using the Lagrangian form. Consider the material derivative of $\mathcal{M}$ multiplied by the volume of a Lagrangian air parcel, $\rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\delta A$
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \delta A \left( u+\Omega r \cos \varphi \right) r \cos \varphi\right].
\end{equation}
Using the chain rule, continuity equation on the form \eqref{eq:lagra_cont}, the equality $v=r\frac{D\varphi}{Dt}$ and substituting \eqref{eq:tmp200}, one can obtain an evolution equation for AAM
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \delta A\, \mathcal{M} \right]=- \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda},\label{eq:tmp201}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, in Eulerian form
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \, \mathcal{M} \right]+\nabla_{\eta_d}\cdot \left[\vec{v} \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)  \mathcal{M} \right]=- \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda}.\label{eq:tmp202}
\end{equation}
Repeatedly using the chain rule one can show that the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmp201} and \eqref{eq:tmp202} can be written as
\begin{align}
- \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda}&=-\frac{\partial }{\partial \lambda}\left[  \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) p\right]+p\frac{\partial }{\partial \lambda} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\\ 
&=-\frac{\partial \quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \lambda}p\right)+\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda}+p\frac{\partial }{\partial \lambda}\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right),\\
&=-\frac{\partial \quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \lambda}p\right)+\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda}-\frac{\partial }{\partial \lambda}\left[ p\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right]-\frac{\partial p}{\partial \lambda}\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right).\\
&=-\frac{\partial \quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \lambda}p\right)-\frac{\partial }{\partial \lambda}\left[ p\left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right].\label{eq:tmp203}
\end{align}
Substituting \eqref{eq:tmp203} on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmp202} and integrating \eqref{eq:tmp202} in the horizontal and vertical we get
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1}\iint_{\mathcal{D}}\left[ \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right) \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right) \mathcal{M} \right] dA\, d\eta^{(d)}=-\iint_{\mathcal{D}}\left[ p_s \frac{\partial z_s}{\partial \lambda}\right] dA,\label{eq:aam_final}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the global domain and $dA=r^2\cos\varphi d\lambda d\varphi$ is an infinitesimal spherical area. The term in the square brackets on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:aam_final} is referred to as the mountain torque. In the absence of topography,$z_s=0$m, \eqref{eq:aam_final} states that the angular momentum integrated over the entire domain is constant for the continuous equations of motion. Note that the AAM can be separated into a part ($\mathcal{M}_r$) associated with the relative motion of the atmosphere with respect to Earth's surface (also known as wind AAM) and another part ($\mathcal{M}_{\Omega}$) associated with the angular velocity $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_r+\mathcal{M}_\Omega=\left( u r \cos \varphi\right)+\left(\Omega r^2 \cos^2 \varphi \right) .
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Total energy}
The derivation of the total energy equation closely follows \citet{K1974MWR} but for a dry mass vertical coordinate and inclusion of condensates in the equations of motion. The equation for the horizontal kinetic energy per unit mass, $K=\frac{1}{2}\vec{v}\cdot \vec{v}$, is derived by multiplying the momentum equations \eqref{E:PEmom} with $\rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)$ and the continuity equation \eqref{eq:cont2} with $K$, adding the two resulting equations and simplifying using the chain rule yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)K\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \left[ \rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)K\right]=-\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\vec{v} \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}p-g\rho \left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\vec{v} \cdot \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}z.\label{eq:K}
\end{equation}
For the derivation of a flux-form version of the total energy equation (that includes a geopotential term) we substitute
\begin{align}
g \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \vec{v} \cdot \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} z &= \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ gz\vec{v}\rho  \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \right] - gz \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \cdot \left[ \vec{v}\rho  \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \right],\\
&=\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ g z\vec{v}\rho  \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \right] -z \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right],\label{eq:tmpK}
\end{align}
(where the hydrostatic balance equation \eqref{eq:phi_1} has been used on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmpK}) on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:K} and rearrange terms
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)K\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \cdot \left[ \rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \left( K+gz \right) \right]=-\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\vec{v} \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}p - z \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\right].\label{eq:tmp1}
\end{equation}
Now, by multiplying the thermodynamic equation \eqref{E:PEtemp} with $\rho \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}c_p$ and the continuity equation \eqref{eq:cont2} with $c_p T$, adding the resulting equations and simplifying using the chain rule yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)c_p T\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \left[ \rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)c_p T\right]=\left( \frac{\partial z\quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\omega.\label{eq:tmp2}
\end{equation}
By using that $\omega\equiv \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+\vec{v} \cdot \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} p$, using the chain rule and the continuity equation \eqref{eq:cont2} , one can show that
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial z\quad}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\omega = \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( z\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\right)+\left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\vec{v} \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}p +z \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ \vec{v} \frac{\partial p\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right].\label{eq:tmp3}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{eq:tmp3} on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmp2} and adding the resulting equation to \eqref{eq:tmp1}, the two terms on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmp1} cancel the two last terms on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:tmp3} and we get the total energy equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\left(K+c_pT\right)\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \left[ \rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \left( K+gz+c_pT \right) \right]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( z\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\right).\label{eq:Etotp}
\end{equation}
This equation is in the same form as (5.7) in \cite{K1974MWR} but $\rho$, $c_p$ and $p$ include the effect of condensates. Noting that
\begin{equation}
c_pT\rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)=c_vT\rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)+g z \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right),
\end{equation}
where we have used the ideal gas law on the form \eqref{eq:ig4}, chain rule and hydrostatic equation on the form \eqref{eq:phi_1}, the total energy equation can be written on the form
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right)\left(K+c_vT+gz\right)\right]+\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \left[ \rho \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial z\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) \left( K+gz+c_pT \right) \right]=-\frac{\partial}{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\left( p\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}\right).\label{eq:Ecv}
\end{equation}
As an aside it is noted that in a $z$-based vertical coordinate (for a moment assume $\eta^{(d)}\equiv z$), if integrating \eqref{eq:Ecv} in the vertical and using that $z$ is constant at the model top ($z_{top}$) and surface ($z_s$) we get
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int_{z=z_s}^{z=z_{top}}\left(K+c_vT+gz\right)\rho dz+\nabla_z \cdot \int_{z=z_s}^{z=z_{top}} \vec{v} \left( K+gz+c_pT \right) \rho dz=0.\label{eq:totEz}
\end{equation}
Note the clear separation of kinetic ($K$), potential ($gz$) and internal ($c_vT$) energy. Integrating \eqref{eq:totEz} in the horizontal over the entire sphere the flux term drops out, and it is clear that the total energy is conserved for the frictionless and adiabatic system of equations.

For the global integral of the total energy equation in a dry-mass vertical coordinate, we substitute the hydrostatic relation on the form \eqref{eq:phi_1} into \eqref{eq:Etotp}, integrate in the vertical and use that the pressure at the model top is constant,
\begin{multline}
\frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1} \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right) \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\left(K+c_pT\right)d \eta^{(d)}\\ +\frac{1}{g}\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \cdot \int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1} \vec{v} \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}\right) \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\left( K+gz+c_pT \right) d \eta^{(d)} =-z_s\frac{\partial p_s}{\partial t},\label{eq:tmp99}
\end{multline}
which can also be written as
\begin{multline}
\frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \left[m^{(\ell)} \left(K+c_p^{(\ell)}T+\Phi_s  \right)\right]d \eta^{(d)}\\ +\frac{1}{g}\nabla_{\eta^{(d)}} \cdot \int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1} \vec{v} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \left[ m^{(\ell)}\left(K+c_p^{(\ell)}T+gz\right) \right]d \eta^{(d)} =0.\label{eq:totEp2}
\end{multline}
by expanding $c_p$ using \eqref{eq:cp}, re-arranging terms and using that $\Phi_s=gz_s$ is time-independent and that 
\begin{equation}
p_s=\int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1}\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}}  \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}}\right) m^{(\ell)}d\eta^{(\eta)}.
\end{equation}
Note that the energy terms (inside square brackets) in \eqref{eq:totEp2} separate into dry air, water vapor, cloud liquid and cloud ice components
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \left[ m^{(\ell)}\left(K+c_p^{(\ell)}T+\Phi_s\right)\right].
\end{equation}
Similarly for the flux term in the second square brackets on the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:totEp2}. Integrating \eqref{eq:totEp2} over the entire sphere results in
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int_{\eta=0}^{\eta=1} \iint_\mathcal{D} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}\quad }{\partial \eta^{(d)}} \right)\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} \left[m^{(\ell)} \left(K+c_p^{(\ell)}T+\Phi_s  \right)\right]  dA d \eta^{(d)}=0.\label{eq:comprehensice_energy}
\end{equation}
We note that the CAM physics package energy fixer assumes that the `perfect' adiabatic dynamical core conserves an energy where $c_p^{(wv)}= c_p^{(d)}$, $c_p^{(\ell)}=0$ for $\ell=`cl`,`ci`$ and $m^{(\ell)}=0$ for $\ell=`cl`,`ci`$ \citep{WOHTTV2015JAMES}. In other words, the CAM energy fixer uses a dry total energy. The discrepancy between the more comprehensive energy formula \eqref{eq:comprehensice_energy} and the CAM physics formula for total energy is about 0.5 $W/m^2$ \citep{T2011LNCSEb}.

\section{Discretized equations of motion}\label{sec:discretized_eqs}
\subsection{Vertical discretization}
In the vertical the atmosphere is discretized into $nlev$ floating Lagrangian layers. The vertical index is 1 for the upper most level and $nlev$ in the lower most level. The level interfaces are referred to as half-levels so that layer k is bounded by interface level $k+1/2$ and $k-1/2$. Since we are using a dry-mass vertical reference coordinate, the dry atmosphere reference pressure at the layer interfaces is defined in terms of the hybrid coefficients $A$ and $B$
 that are only a function of level index
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{(d)}_{k+1/2}=A_{k+1/2}p_t+B_{k+1/2}\mathcal{P}_s^{(d)},\label{eq:ABs}
\end{equation}
and similarly for full levels $k$. Note that if the $`d`$ is removed from the above equation so that the levels are based on moist pressure then the vertical coordinate becomes the usual hybrid vertical coordinate used in many global hydrostatic models. Every $rsplit$ time-steps the floating Lagrangian levels the prognostic variables are remapped to the dry-mass reference coordinate \eqref{eq:ABs} (see Section \ref{sec:verticalRemappin}). 

CAM-SE is based on a Lorenz vertical staggering so the full level prognostic variables are $\vec{v}_k$ (velocity vector), $T_k$ (temperature), $\Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k=\mathcal{P}^{(d)}_{k+1/2}-\mathcal{P}^{(d)}_{k-1/2}$ (dry atmosphere pressure level thickness), and $\Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k m_k^{(\ell)}$ (tracer mass per unit area). At the level interfaces the geopotential, pressure, vertical velocity and density are defined. In the equations of motion the full level pressure, geopotential height, vertical velocity and density are needed and choices must be made on how these variables are derived (in discretized space) from the prognostic variables. Here we use the energy and angular momentum conserving method of \citet{SB1981MWR} to compute these quantities at full levels as discussed in the sections below. For simplicity we do not discretize in the horizontal yet.
\subsubsection{Pressure}\label{sec:pk}
The half-level moist pressure is
\begin{equation}
p_{k+1/2}=p_t+\sum_{j=1}^{nlev}\Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j \left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_j^{(\ell)}\right),\label{eq:halfpfull}
\end{equation}
where $p_t$ is the pressure at the model top, $\eta^{(d)}=0$.
The full level moist pressure is obtained by averaging \citep{SB1981MWR}
\begin{equation}
p_k=\frac{p_{k+1/2}+p_{k-1/2}}{2}.\label{eq:pk}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Geopotential height}
Discretizing \eqref{eq:phi_1} in the vertical yields
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{k+1/2}=\Phi_s+R^{(d)}\sum_j \left( \frac{T_k}{p_k}\right)\, \Delta p_j,
\end{equation}
where the full pressure $p_k$ is given in \eqref{eq:pk}. The half level geopotential is computed by averaging
\begin{equation}
\Phi_k=\frac{\Phi_{k+1/2}+\Phi_{k-1/2}}{2}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Vertical pressure velocity}
The vertical pressure velocity $\omega$ is obtained by discretizing \eqref{eq:omega}. The first term on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:omega} can be computed by using the continuity equations for dry pressure level thickness and water vapor mass in each layer \eqref{E:PEq}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[\sum_{j=1}^k \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j \left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_j^{(\ell)}\right)\right] = -\sum_{j=1}^k \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j\left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_j^{(\ell)} \right)\right],
\end{equation}
so that the vertical pressure velocity at half-levels is given by
\begin{equation}
\omega_{k+1/2}=-\sum_{j=1}^k \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\cdot \left[ \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j\left(\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_j^{(\ell)} \right)\right]+\sum_{j=1}^k \vec{v}_k \cdot \nabla_{\eta^{(d)}}\left[ \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j\left( \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_j^{(\ell)}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
and full level $\omega$ is
\begin{equation}
\omega_k=\frac{\omega_{k+1/2}+\omega_{k-1/2}}{2}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Density}
Full level density is computed from the ideal gas law \eqref{eq:igl}
\begin{equation}
\rho_k=\frac{p_k}{R^{(d)} T_k^{(v)}},
\end{equation}
where the full pressure $p_k$ is computed as described in section \ref{sec:pk}. The virtual temperature is based on prognostic variables defined at the layer centers so simple substitution into \eqref{eq:tv} yields $T_k^{(v)}$. Similarly for the computation of $\left( c_p\right)_k$.
\subsubsection{Vertical remapping}\label{sec:verticalRemappin}
To avoid excessive deformation or even crossing of the floating Lagrangian levels, the prognostic variables defined at
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{(d)}_{k+1/2}=p_t+\sum_{j=1}^{k}\Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_j,
\end{equation}
are remapped back to the (Eulerian) reference levels given in \eqref{eq:ABs} every $rsplit$ time-steps \citep{L2004MWR}. In the remapping process we enforce conservation of mass by mapping $m^{(\ell)}_k\Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k$ using the piecewise-parabolic method \cite[PPM; ][]{CW1984JCP} and applying a standard shape-preserving limiter to avoid unphysical (in particular negative) mixing ratios in the remapping process. The internal energy is also conserved during the remapping process by mapping $\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} c_p^{(\ell)} m_k^{(\ell)}T_k \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k$. Note that temperature must be recovered from the internal energy using the remapped tracer values for $m^{(\ell)}_k$. A shape-preserving filter is also used for the remapping of internal energy so that an isothermal profile remains isothermal if the limiter is active on one of the water variables, $m^{(\ell)}_k$. Note that if the limiter is active at the same points for more than one of the water species then we can not guarantee preservation of an isothermal atmosphere when non-linear limiting filters are turned on \citep[see, e.g., Section 2.5 in ][]{LT2011QJR}.

The moist mass-weighted velocity components, $\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m^{(\ell)}_k \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k u_k$ and $\sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_{all}} m_k^{(\ell)} \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k v_k$ respectively, are remapped separately. Mapping the moist mass weighted velocity components conservatively leads to an angular momentum conserving vertical remapping algorithm. For the velocity components we do not enforce shape-preservation in the vertical remapping process to reduce the amount of kinetic energy dissipation.
\subsection{Horizontal discretization using the SE method}
\input{sem}

% CAM-SE is based on a continuous Galerkin finite-element (or spectral-element) method \citep{TTI1997JCP} and is discretized using a cubed-sphere tiling of the sphere. Petascale scalability of CAM-SE was demonstrated in \cite{DetAl2012IJHPCA}. Also, CAM-SE provided refined mesh functionality in CAM \cite[e.g., ][]{SJDTT2008MWR,ZetAl2014JC}, improved accuracy of idealized baroclinic wave simulation \citep{LJTN2010JAMES}, conserved total energy to time-truncation errors \citep{T2011LNCSEb} and improved global axial angular momentum budgets compared to CAM-FV \citep{LBDL2014JAMES}. That said, the tracer transport component of CAM-SE appeared to be less accurate than CAM-FV for non-smooth tracer distributions \citep{LetAl2011GMD,HetAl2016QJRMS}. In an idealized terminator test in which two species react according to a reaction coefficient proportional to the solar terminator while being transported by an idealized 2D flow, CAM-SE produces errors larger than CAM-FV \citep{LCLVT2015GMD}. The errors are due to the limiter used for tracer transport that prevents oscillatory (and in particular negative) solutions for tracers \citep{GTS2014JCP}. In terms of computational throughput it was also found that CAM-SE was slower for large tracer counts (at least when run with core counts similar to the non-scalable CAM-FV).

\subsection{Temporal discretization}
In a typical CAM setup where the model top is around 40km the maximum stable time-step for solving the continuity equation for $\ell='wv','cl','ci'$ (referred to as tracer advection) is limited by the maximum advective winds. The maximum stable time-step for the remaining equations of motion (thermodynamic equation, momentum equations and the continuity equation for dry air) is limited by the fastest gravity waves.  Since the maximum advective winds are typically slower than the fastest gravity waves, different time-stepping methods are used for tracer advection and the remaining equations of motion. The same time-step is used but different Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are used to maintain stability. 

The SE tracer advection algorithm uses a three-stage RK strong-stability-preserving (SSP) time-stepping method that ensures that the time step will preserve any shape-preserving properties preserved by the underlying spatial discretization\citep{SR2002SIAM}. The shape-preserving filter used is described in \citet{GTS2014JCP}. The shape-preserving SE tracer advection algorithm is formally second-order accurate.{\color{red}{[limiter applied in last RK step?]}}

The momentum, thermodynamic and dry air continuity equations are solved using a third-order accurate five-stage Runga-Kutta method (RK5) based on a modified version of \cite{KG1984MCSb,KG1984MCS} described in \cite{GU2016GMD}. The inviscid equations of motion are advanced one dynamics time-step using the RK5 method followed by the application of hyperviscosity operators by solving the advection-diffusion equation on the updated prognostic variables. Note that it is necessary to subcycle the hyperviscosity-step for stability. The viscosity terms are computed as described in section \ref{sec:hyper} and discretized using the SE method presented in \ref{sec:dissipation}.

{\color{red}{[How is tracer advection coupled to dry air continuity equation??]}} 

The time-steps in CAM-SE are controlled with namelist variables {\tt{se\_nsplit}},{\tt{se\_rsplit}},
{\tt{se\_hypervis\_subcycle}}  so that the time-steps for vertical remapping $\Delta t_{remap}$, tracer advection $\Delta t_{trac}$ (RK3), RK5 time-stepping for non-tracers $\Delta t_{dyn}$, and hyperviscosity $\Delta t_{hyper}$ are
\begin{align}
\Delta t_{remap}&=\frac{\Delta t_{phys}}{\tt{se\_nsplit}},\\
\Delta t_{dyn}&=\frac{\Delta t_{phys}}{\tt{se\_nsplit*se\_rsplit}},\\
\Delta t_{hyper}&=\frac{\Delta t_{phys}}{\tt{se\_nsplit*se\_rsplit*se\_hypervis\_subcycle}},\\
\end{align}
where $\Delta t_{phys}$ is the time-step used for computing physics tendencies.
%
\subsection{Coupling to physics}
CAM-SE uses a time-split {\color{red}{[(CHECK if it is process or time split)]}} in which dynamics advances the model state and then the physics tendencies are based on the dynamics updated state. The question is then how to add the physics tendencies to the dynamical core. CAM-SE supports several physics-dynamics coupling methods. Let $F_X$ be the physics tendency for prognostic variable $X$ in level $k$ (for notational simplicity the vertical index is dropped). The different coupling methods are detailed below and are identified with the rather arbitrary name `ftype'. A fuller discussion with results about different coupling methods is the content of a separate paper. Some results are given by C. Jablonowski in \cite[][; see section 6]{GetAl2016}.
\subsubsection{`ftype=0' configuration}
In this case add $\Delta t_{remap}F_X$ to the state of $X$, advance the dynamics $\Delta t_{remap}$ seconds based on the updated state, add $\Delta t_{remap}F_X$ to the dynamics updated state of $X$ and advance the dynamics core, and so on. In other words, the forcing is split into $\frac{\Delta t_{phys}}{\Delta_{remap}}$ equal chunks and added throughout the dynamics. 

The CAM parameterization package returns mixing ratio tendencies for tracers. We convert the mixing ratio tendencies to mass tendencies $F_x \Delta \mathcal{P}^{(d)}_k$ since the prognostic variable for tracers in the dynamical core is $\Delta p_k m^{(d)}_k$.

Generally modelers do not allow the tracer tendencies to drive the mixing ratio of tracers negative, however, this may happen using `ftype=0'. If the tendency drives a mixing ratio negative the mixing ratio is set to zero. As a result not the entire tracer tendency is added leading to an inconsistency is how much mass the physics package wants to remove and the amount of tracer mass actually removed in the physics-dynamics coupling code in the dynamical core.
\subsubsection{`ftype=1' configuration}
In this configuration the entire physics forcing is added to the dynamics state $\Delta t_{phys}F_X$ which is equivalent to have the physics module update the model state. This coupling methods is used in CAM-FV \citep{L2004MWR}. Note that contrary to the `ftype=0' configuration, this configuration always provides a closed mass budget for tracers in terms of physics tendencies being fully applied in the dynamical core.
\subsubsection{`ftype=2' configuration}
This configuration constitutes a hybrid approach where mass variables (tracers) used `ftype=1' physics-dynamics coupling method and all other variables use the `ftype=0' method.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
The evaluation of the SE dynamical core with CAM6 physics in AMIP configuration simulation is the subject of a separate paper. Here the new dynamical core is evaluated in simpler setups. First the new dynamical core version is compared with the old version using an idealized moist baroclinic wave without the complexity of a full physics parameterization suite. It is confirmed that the new SE dynamical core version converges to within the uncertainty of high resolution reference solutions computed with the old SE dynamical core (that has been extensively validated) and the `workhorse' dynamical for $1^\circ$ climate simulation; CAM-FV \citep[finit-volume][]{L2004MWR}. Second, the dynamical core is evaluated in aqua-planet setup \citep{NH2000ASL,WetAl2012NCAR,MWO2016JAMES} using CAM6 physics. .... {\color{red}{[bla bla ...]}}
\subsection{Idealized moist baroclinic wave with Kessler microphysics}
For the validation of the new dynamical core version in a simplified setup, we use a moist variant of the dry baroclinic wave of \citet{UMJS2014QJRMS} with Kessler microphysics \citep{K1969MM}. This test case configuration was part of the Dynamical Core Model Intercomparison Project (DCMIP) 2016 test case suite {\color{red}{[DCMIP citation]}}. The initialization of the atmospheric state for the moist baroclinic wave is based on analytic expressions for $T_v$, $\vec{v}$, p and $q^{(wv)}$ as a function of latitude and height; $(\varphi,z)$. The surface geopotential is constant, $\Phi_s=0$, and the moist surface pressure is constant $p_s=1000hPa$. The analytical expressions for temperature, velocity components, moist pressure and specific humidity, denoted ${T_v}(\varphi,z)$, ${\vec{v}}(\varphi,z)$, ${p}(\varphi,z)$, and $q^{(wv)}(\varphi,z)$, respectively, are given in Appendix \ref{app:analytic}. When using a moist vertical pressure coordinate, the full level pressures $p_k$ of the initial condition are known from the hybrid coefficients, $A_k$ and $B_k$, and one can iteratively solve for $z_k$ given moist pressure: $p_k={p}(\varphi,z_k)$ \citep[see, ][]{UMJS2014QJRMS}. Once the full level heights, $z_k(\varphi)$, are known then the specific humidity, virtual temperature and velocity components can be computed by evaluating the analytical expressions at $(\varphi,z_k)$. In the DCMIP 2016 test case documentation the virtual temperature is converted to temperature using $T_v=T\left( 1+\epsilon q^{(wv)}\right)$. For a dry-mass vertical coordinate model the initialization procedure is more complicated as described below.

\subsubsection{Initialization of the moist baroclinic wave using a dry-mass vertical coordinate}
The challenge is to extract dry pressure from the initial state defined in terms of moist pressure and preserve a balanced initial condition. For that we write the dry atmosphere hydrostatic relation \eqref{eq:dry_atm_hydro} in terms of specific humidity, virtual temperature and moist pressure
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{P}^{(d)}}{\partial z}&=&-\rho_d\, g,\\
&=&-\frac{\rho}{1+m^{(wv)}}\, g,\\
&=&-\frac{p}{R^{(d)}T_v}\frac{1}{\left( 1+m^{(wv)}\right)}\, g,\\
&=&-\frac{p}{R^{(d)}T_v}\left(1-q^{(wv)}\right)g,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have substituted the ideal gas law and used that $\left( \frac{1}{1+m^{(wv)}} \right)=\left( 1-q^{(wv)} \right)$ for an atmosphere not containing any condensates. Hence the dry pressure as a function of latitude, $\varphi$, and height, $z$, is
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}(\varphi,z)=p_t-\int_z^{z_t}\frac{p(\varphi,z)}{R^{(d)} T_v(\varphi,z)}\left(1-q^{(wv)}(\varphi,z)\right) g\, dz,\label{eq:Upd}
\end{equation}
where $z_t$ is the height of the model top computed by iteratively solving \eqref{eq:baroPmoist} with $p(\varphi,z)=p_t$ (assuming there is no moisture above the model top). To initialize the dry pressure levels a dry surface pressure is needed. It is computed by integrating \eqref{eq:Upd} with lower integral bound $z=z_s=0\, m$ and approximating the integral using 20 point Gaussian quadrature. The dry surface pressure is shown on Figure \ref{fig:baro_init}. The full dry pressure levels are given in terms of the hybrid coefficients ${\mathcal{P}_k^{(d)}}(\varphi,z_k)=A_k p_t+B_k {\mathcal{P}_s^{(d)}}(\varphi,z_k)$. The height, $z_{k}(\varphi)$, of the full dry pressure levels are computed by iteratively solving \eqref{eq:Upd} with ${\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}(\varphi,z)={\mathcal{P}}_{k}^{(d)}(\varphi,z_k)$. Once the heights are known the virtual temperature and velocity components can be computed by evaluating the analytical expressions at $(\varphi,z_k)$ as is done for the moist vertical coordinate initialization. If we do the same for specific humidity then the moist surface pressure (which is a diagnostic when using dry-mass vertical coordinates) deviates more than 1 Pa in the tropics from the analytical value of 1000hPa  (see Figure \ref{fig:baro_init}). As a result a spurious zonal signal in surface pressure with the same amplitude as the initial gravity waves appears in the simulations. Hence specific humidity must be initialized more carefully in order to obtain a more balanced initial condition which is discussed in the next paragraph. 

As for $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}$, the weight of water vapor $\mathcal{P}^{(d)}$ per unit area can be written as
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal{P}}^{(wv)}(\varphi,z)=-\int_z^{z_t}\frac{p(\varphi,z)}{R^{(d)} T_v(\varphi,z)}q^{(wv)}(\varphi,z)\, g\, dz,\label{eq:Upvw}
\end{equation}
so that the moist pressure (in the absence of condensates) at half levels can be computed as the sum of dry air and water vapor pressures
\begin{equation}
p(\varphi,z_{k+1/2})={\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}(\varphi,z_{k+1/2})+{\mathcal{P}}^{(wv)}(\varphi,z_{k+1/2}),
\end{equation}
where $z_{k+1/2}$ is computed by the same iterative procedure as for full levels. An integrated value for water vapor in a layer can now be computed from
\begin{equation}
m^{(wv)}(\varphi,z_k)=\frac{p(\varphi,z_{k+1/2})-p(\varphi,z_{k-1/2})}{{\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}(\varphi,z_{k+1/2})-{\mathcal{P}}^{(d)}(\varphi,z_{k-1/2})}-1.
\end{equation}
Using this method for initializing the mixing ratio for water vapor the moist surface pressure is within 0.01 Pa of the analytical value of $10^5$ Pa (see Figure \ref{fig:baro_init}). Once $m^{(wv)}(\varphi,z_k)$ the temperature $T(\varphi,z_k)$ can recovered from $T_v(\varphi,z_k)$ by using \eqref{eq:tv}.

\caption{(Upper) Zonally averaged dry (orange) and moist (blue) surface pressure as a function of latitude for the numerically computed initial condition for the moist baroclinic wave at $1^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution and 30 levels (CAM5 configuration).

(lower) Same as the upper plot but showing moist surface pressure where water vapor has been initialized by evaluating the analytic specific humidity formula at full levels (purple) and initializing the mixing ratio for water vapor in terms of moist and dry pressures at half levels which effectively integrates humidity over the layer (blue).

\label{fig:baro_init}
\end{figure}

%a shows the dry surface pressure as a function of latitude numerically computed with \eqref{eq:Upd}. From this surface pressure the dry pressure at model levels are computed from \eqref{eq:ABs}. We then iteratively solve \eqref{eq:Upd} to find the height $z_k$ of the full levels and this $z_k$ is then used to initialize temperature, wind and water vapor mixing ratio using the analytic expressions given in Appendix \ref{app:analytic}. The moist surface pressure can then be computed with \eqref{eq:halfpfull}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:baro_init}(b) the diagnostic moist surface pressure is less than a Pascal of the analytic moist surface pressure of 1000hPa and the zonal structure in moist surface pressure has a much smaller amplitude than the gravity waves initially propagating from the wind perturbation.

\subsubsection{Simulation results}
As part of the `CESM simpler models' effort started by \citet{CESM_SIMPLER_MODELS}, the baroclinic wave setup has been implemented rigorously in the CESM in the sense that the configuration easily runs from CESM without code configurations using the `{\bf{FKESSLER}} compset'. For instructions on how to run the moist baroclinic wave with Kessler microphysics see \citet{FKESSLER}. Since the test case configuration has been implemented in the full CESM, the dynamical core interacts with the physics module as in full climate model simulations. Hence the global energy fixer is invoked \citep{WOHTTV2015JAMES} and for the dynamical cores using a moist pressure vertical coordinate there is an adjustment of specific humidity to conserve water after the moist physics updates \citep[see Section 3.1.6 in ][]{CAM5}. The intent of this implementation is to evaluate the dynamical core in simplified setup but exactly as the dynamical core is configured for comprehensive climate simulations.

Figure \ref{fig:baro_wave} shows the evolution of the moist baroclinic wave at day 10 using the CAM-FV \citep[Finite-Volume; ][]{L2004MWR} dynamical core, CAM-HOMME dynamical core based on a moist vertical coordinate and the new dynamical core version (CAM-SE). The CAM-HOMME and CAM-SE (CESM2-SE) dynamical cores not only differ in terms of vertical coordinates but also in terms of hyperviscosity and the formula used for the heat-capacity in the thermodynamic equation. CAM-HOMME uses $c_p^{(d)}$ whereas CAM-SE (CESM2.0-SE) uses the comprehensive formula \eqref{eq:cp} that includes the heat capacity of water vapor.

\section{Analytical initial condition functions}\label{app:analytic}
In this section the analytical expressions for the moist baroclinic wave are given. The moist surface pressure is constant $p_s=1000$ $hPa$, meridional wind component is zero, $v(\varphi,z)=0$ $m/s$, and the surface geopotential is zero, $\Phi_s(\varphi,z)=0$ $m^2/s^2$. The reference virtual temperature is given by
\begin{equation}
T_v(\varphi, z) = \left\{\mathcal{F}_1(z)-\mathcal{F}_2(z) \left[ (\cos \varphi )^{\mathcal{K}}-\frac{{\mathcal{K}}}{{\mathcal{K}}+2}(\cos \varphi )^{{\mathcal{K}}+2}\right]\right\}^{-1},
\label{virtTemp}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_1(z) &= \frac{1}{T_0} \exp\left(\frac{\Gamma z}{T_0}\right) + \left( \frac{T_0-T_P}{T_0T_P} \right)\left[1-2\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right] \exp\left[-\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right] \\
\mathcal{F}_2(z) &= \frac{({\mathcal{K}} + 2)}{2} \left( \frac{T_E-T_P}{T_E T_P} \right) \left[1-2\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right] \exp\left[-\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right],
\end{align} 
with $T_0 = \tfrac{1}{2} (T_E + T_P)$.  Parameter $T_E=310$ ${\mathcal{K}}$ is the temperature at the Equatorial surface, $T_P=240$ ${\mathcal{K}}$ is the polar surface temperature, ${\mathcal{K}}=3$ is the jet width parameter, $b=2$ is the jet half-width parameter, and $\Gamma=0.005$ $K/m$ is the lapse rate.

To maintain hydrostatic balance, the pressure is given by:
\begin{equation}
p(\varphi, z) = p_0\exp \left[ -\frac{g}{R^{(d)}}(\mathcal{F}_{3}(z) -\mathcal{F}_{4}(z) \mathcal{I}_T(\varphi) ) \right]\label{eq:baroPmoist}
\end{equation} where
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_{3}(z) &=\frac{1}{\Gamma} \left[ \exp\left( \frac{\Gamma z}{T_0} \right)-1 \right] + z \left(\frac{T_0-T_P}{T_0T_P} \right) \exp\left[-\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right] \\
\mathcal{F}_{4}(z) &=\frac{({\mathcal{K}}+2)}{2} \left(\frac{T_E-T_P}{T_E T_P} \right) z \exp\left[-\left(\frac{z g}{b R^{(d)} T_0}\right)^2\right].
\end{align}    
To define the zonal velocity component define the great circle distance between $(\lambda,\varphi)$ and $(\lambda_p,\varphi_p)$:
\begin{equation}
r(\lambda, \varphi; \lambda_p, \varphi_p) = a \arccos \left( \sin \varphi \sin \varphi_p + \cos \varphi \cos \varphi_p \cos (\lambda - \lambda_p) \right).
\end{equation}
The zonal velocity component is
\begin{equation}
u(\varphi, z) = -\Omega a \cos(\varphi)+\sqrt{(\Omega a\cos(\varphi))^2+ a\cos(\varphi)U(\varphi,z)}+u^\prime(\lambda, \varphi, z),
\end{equation} where the zonally symmetric part of the velocity field is given by
\begin{equation}
U(\varphi,z) = \frac{g {\mathcal{K}}}{a} \mathcal{F}_{4}(z) \left[ (\cos \varphi)^{{\mathcal{K}} - 1} - (\cos \varphi)^{{\mathcal{K}} + 1} \right] T_v(\varphi, z),
\end{equation} 
$a=6371.22$ $m$ is the mean radius of Earth and angular velocity is $\Omega=\frac{2\pi}{86164}$ $\frac{1}{s}$ (denominator is length of day is seconds), and $u^\prime(\lambda, \varphi, z)$ is the exponential bell-shaped perturbation to the zonally balanced velocity field
\begin{equation}
u^\prime(\lambda, \varphi, z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} U_p Z(z)  \exp \left[ - \left( \frac{r(\lambda, \varphi; \lambda_p, \varphi_p)}{r_p} \right)^2 \right], & \mbox{if $r(\lambda, \varphi; \lambda_p, \varphi_p) < r_p$,} \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise,} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation} where perturbation velocity is $U_p=1$ $m/s$, longitude/latitude of the zonal wind perturbation centerpoint is $(\lambda_p,\varphi_p)$=$(\pi/9,2\pi/9)$=$(20^{\circ}$E,$40^{\circ}$N),  and
\begin{equation}
Z(z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle 1 - 3 \left( \frac{z}{z_p} \right)^2 + 2 \left( \frac{z}{z_p} \right)^3, & \mbox{if $z \leq z_p$,} \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise,} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
where $z_p=15000$ $m$ is the maximum height of the zonal wind perturbation. The specific humidity (moist mixing ratio for water vapor) is specified in terms of moist pressure (as the vertical variable)
\begin{eqnarray}
q^{(wv)}(\lambda, \varphi, p) &=& \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} q_0 \exp\left[- \left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi_{w}}\right)^4 \right] \exp\left[- \left(\frac{p-p_0}{p_{w}}\right)^2  \right], & \mbox{if $p > p_0 / 10$,} \\ q_{t}, & \mbox{otherwise.} \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray} 
where $p_w=340$ $hPa$ is a pressure width parameter, $q_0=0.018$ $kg/kg$ is maximum specific humidity, $q_t=1.0\times 10^{-12}$ $kg/kg$ is specific humidity above artificial tropopause, $\varphi_{w}=2\pi/9$ is the specific humidity latitudinal width parameter. In addition to water vapor the Kessler microphysics water species are cloud liquid, $m^{(cl)}$, and rain water, $m^{(rw)}$. Both are initialized to zero kg/kg.

%   \notation{$e=mc^2$} 
%   Equation in German-born physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special
%  relativity that showed that the increased relativistic mass ($m$) of a
%  body comes from the energy of motion of the body—that is, its kinetic
%  energy ($E$)—divided by the speed of light squared ($c^2$).

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
